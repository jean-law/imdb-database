# imdb-database
Project under INF553, a course on Database Management Systems. The ultimate goal of this project is to set up a Web application that enables users to exploit a movie database, which is a version of the IMDB1 dataset.

## Description of files:
- step1-jean-law.md: contains the Postgres (version 12) commands necessary to create the database with the necessary constraints.
- step-2-query-optimization.pdf: report detailing how we optimized SQL queries that were performing slowly on the database.
